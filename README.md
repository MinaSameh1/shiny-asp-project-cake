# shiny-asp-project-cake
a college Project that was made for chi college, made in one week :D 

#### Note: Github is the one responsible for this name 

I also wrote tests using cypress and faker (Better than using VS2010 for tests xc) to test out the website, it has 
one for every part of the website, and one large test that took me like a 100 seconds to run on a win10 vm but 20-30 seconds on real life hardware.

I don't consider this project perfect but it got the job done and it was the first time trying out test driven develompent, really fun and helpful,
I am glad on how it came out.

I recommend checking out [Database](https://github.com/MinaSameh1/shiny-asp-project-cake/blob/master/ProjectSol/ASPProject/ASPProject/Classes/Database.cs) file and the [Cypress](https://github.com/MinaSameh1/shiny-asp-project-cake/tree/master/cypress/integration) directory :) 

I used themes from [Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/) all pages are from them and modified for personal use. 

(~Don't judge my commit messages it was a rushed project ok?)
